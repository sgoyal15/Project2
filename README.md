# Project2

-> This repo focuses on the project 2 of ECE601 i.e., Emergency Services and Disaster Management using Google Maps API

-> The focuses to develop an application that empowers communities, emergency responders, and local authorities to efficiently prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters by provoiding real time info using various APIs

-> The APIs are not loading anymore, I tried creating anew one using the google service, but its still not working, the screenshots will give a basic idea how the application will work.
